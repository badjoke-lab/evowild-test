# EvoWild Run — S-type recovery checkpoint

current_stage: S-blockout-v10 broader lift plus weighted fairing saved, review pending
branch: feat/s-creature-model
current_model_file: output/S-blockout-v10.blend

done:
- Opened the saved S-blockout-v2.blend directly.
- Used S_EDITABLE_SOURCE as the edit source.
- Narrowed the lower two Neck_integrated_keel cross sections by 15%.
- Applied the local lower-neck/chest-junction deformation to the continuous surface.
- Preserved the continuous central skull and crest vertices.
- Saved the interrupted state as output/S-blockout-v3-recovery.blend.
- Stopped Blender, render, and modeling work for recovery.
- Applied the specified ventral-only lower-neck/chest junction displacement once to the continuous surface (6738 vertices), preserving lateral coordinates and topology.
- Saved output/S-blockout-v4.blend without rendering or GLB export.

- Applied second deterministic ventral-only correction (18% max of ventral excess with smooth section/radial falloff); lateral width/topology/protected forward region unchanged.

- Applied v6 anterior-thorax correction once: central lower-front chest moved backward/upward under the specified smooth bounds while X, topology, vertex count, neck width, forelimb/scapular protected surfaces, and all other regions remained fixed.

- Applied v7 broader thorax correction from v5 baseline; v6 was not used as input. Field widened laterally and displacement reduced to avoid the central smile-crease while keeping X/topology/count/neck width/root protections fixed.

- Applied v8 sternum-plane correction from v7: only the remaining central lower-chest lobe was moved toward a shallow sloped ventral plane; X/topology/count/neck width/root protections remain fixed.

- Applied v9 constrained Y/Z sternum relaxation from v8: five weighted local iterations, X/topology/count/neck width/root protections and boundaries fixed.

- Applied v10 broader shallow lift plus weighted Y/Z fairing from v7 clean baseline; v8/v9 fold geometry not inherited. X/topology/count/neck width/root protections fixed.

next_action: Inspect v10 front/front34/side against reference 01. Confirm the central sternum lobe/fold is reduced, the chest remains lighter than v7, and no root or neck-width silhouette changed.

quality_issues:
- v6 is REVISE: the central-only chest lift created a visible horizontal smile-crease/shelf in front and front34. The lower-neck width remains accepted; the remaining correction must be broader and shallower across the anterior thorax.
- The creature remains an unfinished blockout.
- Crown, shoulder planes, hindlimb joints, and feet still retain the prior v2 issues.

neck_subtask_decision: KEEP
neck_subtask_reason: v5 no longer reads too narrow in front/front34; further ventral-only neck deformation gives diminishing returns. Remaining mismatch is primarily anterior thorax/shoulder massing, not neck width.

- output/review/v6/S_blockout_rear34.png

thorax_v6_decision: REVISE
thorax_v6_reason: front/front34 show a new horizontal smile-crease caused by the narrow central displacement/protection boundary; side improvement is insufficient to justify keeping that artifact.
thorax_v6_recovery_rule: build v7 from S-blockout-v5.blend, not from v6.

- output/review/v7/S_blockout_rear34.png

thorax_v7_decision: REVISE
thorax_v7_reason: v7 successfully removes the v6 smile-crease, but front/front34 still show a distinct rounded central sternum lobe hanging between the shoulders; side remains heavier than reference 01.
thorax_v7_keep: use v7 as base; do not revert to v5 and do not reintroduce v6 central-only field.

- output/review/v8/S_blockout_rear34.png

thorax_v8_decision: REVISE
thorax_v8_reason: side profile is lighter and closer to target, but front/front34 introduce a stronger folded smile/crease across the sternum. Do not revert the whole shape; keep v8 position and relax only the local Y/Z surface continuity.
thorax_v8_keep: preserve v8 overall chest position as v9 base.

review_status_v9: v9 review rendered / not accepted

- output/review/v9/S_blockout_rear34.png

thorax_v9_decision: REVISE
thorax_v9_reason: the constrained relax moved 2982 vertices but max total delta was only 0.00142, so front/front34 are visually almost unchanged from v8 and the sternum fold remains.
thorax_v10_base: use S-blockout-v7.blend as the clean no-fold baseline; do not inherit v8/v9 fold geometry.
